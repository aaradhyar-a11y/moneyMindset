# moneyMindset
I am Aaradhya Rai. This is my website named: Money Mindset.
The website theme is FinTech for students.
This website is a finance game that teaches students how to manage their money at a young age, as this is a concept that is not taught in schools and is a neccessary concept for students to learn. 
In the website, it starts of with a page describing what the user has to do and about the game with a start button. 
After the game starts, different scenarios will come, and the user has to choose what they want to do with the money left in the specific scenario, when they spend, the money will be cut off from their limit given at the beginning of the game which is 5000 rupess, or any currency.
When they save, it will be stored, and wont be cut off from their total amount. When they invest, the amount of money will be cut off and an investing outcome will come as an announcement showing wether it was a profit or loss, and how much they lost or got.

My Website is different from other websites because, it solves an issue which is students not learning basic money managment skills at a young age, and these skills are not even taught at school, I wanted to create a website which teaches these skills in a fun way, making students play it more and become better at managing simple money.

Citation of AI: I have used ChatGPT:
1. In my javascript file: script.js: In the background code of the button to change the page.
2. In the CSS file: style.css: For the top-right panel, coding it's position.
3. In the javascript file: data.js: To create the scenarios and life events.

Progress:
I first created the home page where i have the website name, about it, the instructions and the start button. it took me some time to get it working as there were a lot of bugs, so I used ChatGPT to fix my bugs and then i moved on to writing my scenarios, life events, buttons, and panel. That took me a long time and i had a lot of bugs so I ended up using ChatGPT jsut to fix my bugs, then i continued writing the code. I tested it a lot of times, fixed bugs and then finished my website.
